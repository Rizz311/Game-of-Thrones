# Game-of-Thrones
This is a simple API project that I was working on in class that can give you the names from all 2138 characters in Game Of Thrones.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,JQuery, and API

I used a simple html form and input to start off and give the ability to enter text for character selection. From there I went into the javascript. I first searched for a valid API source that was recent and up to date. From there I knew I had an endpoint and used the url in my ajax and created a success and error function. In the event of a success it would console and append a name of the selected person. A error will log the possible error.

## Optimizations
I will go back and add to the features and include more then just a character name. I will also add images and CSS the images will come when I find more API's that can support my idea and make a more complex API.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about API's and how to parse a JSON response back. I felt a big breakthough when I got my first response back and got it to append to the DOM and plan to have more appending to the DOM and eventually add more to my Game Of Thrones project.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
